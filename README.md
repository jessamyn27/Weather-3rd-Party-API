## Wireframes

## Bugs and Known Issues

- clicking on already searched cities replaces the button, would be better to maintain and not clear until user does another search

## Next Steps to Continue

### Next Steps for App UI and Functionality

- hover and click IU could use color or highlight change
- animation or background changing based on current day weather would be cool

## SudoCode of Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
